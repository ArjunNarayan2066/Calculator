x^2 + 1, but with many 0'd terms in front (0X^8 etc..)
1x^4 + 0x^3 .... all zero's

To avoid 1st case, maybe change terms for entering factorQuad & factorLinear
	If the first non-zero entry is @ index order - cnt such that this == 2, then the first non-zero entry is @ 2 and it is quadratic

To avoid 2nd case (where the calculations never reach 0 and are off), maybe increase precision, or always do a hard coded test on 0

Test -> does compute function work w/ complex numbers?????

All Arbitrary Values Used:
	-10 & 10 as newtMethod real guesses
	10-10i & 10+10i as newtMethod complex guesses
	10**-12 as good enough precision


Conditions for complex/real testing

indexNonZero = function.

if (len(function)%2 == 1) and (order > 3) #High Order even function
	test complex

else #Everything Else 
	test real

after each invidividual test come back here & re-evaluate with smaller function.
Question: Will newtMethod work the same if I give it a complex or real????
